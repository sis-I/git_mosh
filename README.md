This is my First Public git repository to try out git commands
as per youtube tutorial(Git Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 Hour link >> 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE') by >>Programming with Mosh, which is one of youtube channels of my preference learning coding from youtube.

I have been using github for cloning public repositories, and I tried git with github in private repository, but this is one of my trials using git with github which is made public.

Edit README.md and commit the edit in github.com
Update README.md in an update_readme branch

This line is add in github in a ghub_branch created in github

This line is add from local update-readme branch
