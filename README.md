This is my First Public git repository to try out git commands
as per youtube tutorial(Git Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 Hour link >> 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE') by >>Programming with Mosh, which is one of youtube channels of my preference learning coding from youtube.

I have been using github for cloning public repositories, and I tried git with github in private repository, but this is one of my trials using git with github which is made public.
